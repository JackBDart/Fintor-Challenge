# Fintor Coding Challenge

This app was developed as part of a coding challenge for the company Fintor. It is the implementation of a user page on a "CookingRecipes" app, using expo, React Native, and AWS dynamoDB with graphQL. The main functionality of the app is the ability to create, update, and delete a user's personal recipes.

To run the app, pull code from the repository, run the `npm install` command in the terminal, and then run `expo start` to start the app.
